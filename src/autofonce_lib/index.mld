autoconf is a modern runner for GNU Autoconf Testsuites:
autoconf has a limited understanding of m4 macros that appear in testsuites
written for the GNU Autoconf testsuites, and can run such tests in a modern
way:
* automatic run from any directory
* short display focusing on failed tests
* automatic parallelism



The entry point of this library is the module: {!Autofonce_lib}.

synopsis: "autofonce: modern runner for GNU Autoconf Testsuites"
description: """\
autofonce is a modern runner for GNU Autoconf Testsuites:
autofonce has a limited understanding of m4 macros that appear in testsuites
written for the GNU Autoconf testsuites, and can run such tests in a modern
way:
* automatic run from any directory
* short display focusing on failed tests
* automatic parallel execution
* automatic promotion of tests outputs
